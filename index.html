        <p>A web browser is a software application used to access and view websites on the internet.<br> It allows users to interact with various forms of online content, including text, images, videos, and more.<br>Web browsers retrieve information from the web and display it on a user's device in a format that is easy to read and navigate.<br></p>
        <p>Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera.<br> Each browser has its own set of features, but they all perform the same basic functions, such as loading web pages, managing bookmarks, and running web-based applications.<br></p>
        <p>Browsers operate through a process called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or its more secure version, HTTPS.<br> When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of a browser, it sends a request to the web server hosting that website.<br> The server responds by sending the necessary files, and the browser interprets them to display the content.<br></p>
        <p>Modern web browsers also offer features like incognito mode for private browsing,<br> extensions to add functionality, and support for various web technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to enhance the user's browsing experience.<br></p>
        <p>Overall, web browsers are an essential tool for navigating the vast amount of information available on the internet today.<br></p>
